# **Yo!**
## Hey, I uploaded all YoProject files since I won't support it anymore.
> Do "npm i" in Yo!'s directory with NodeJS installed (https://nodejs.org/en/).
> Then, run Yo! by completing the config.json file and running the command "node ." in your terminal.

## Credits:
> Lyx: Lyxcode Command & Event handlers and LoadEvent file.\n
> EnderTower: Nearly all of the code.
